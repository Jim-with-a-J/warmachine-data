	"additionalDie": "An additional die is a die added to the number of dice a model would ordinarily roll. A die roll can include multiple additional dice as long as each additional die comes from a different rule. A roll can be {boost}ed and gain additional dice.",
	"battlegroup": "A warcaster and the warjacks they control and a warlock and the warbeasts they control are collectively referred to as battlegroups.",
	"blind": "A model suffering Blind cannot make ranged or magic attacks, suffers -4 MAT and DEF, and cannot run, charge, or make slam or trample power attacks. It must forfeit either its Normal Movement or Combat Action during its next activation. Blind can be {shaken}.",
	"boost": "Boosting a roll allows you to roll one extra die. If a model has a rule that gives it the option to boost a roll, you must declare it is boosting before rolling any dice for the roll. Each attack or damage roll can be boosted only once, but a model can boost multiple, different rolls during its activation. When an attack affects several models, the attack and damage rolls against each individual model must be boosted separately.",
